# Exercise 3 (Synchronization)

In the exercise we are requested to perform synchronization in POSIX threads using:
* mutexes, semaphores and condition variables
* atomic operation, based on builtin commands of GCC

In the **first exercise** the synchronization is being done on an existing code.

In the **second exercise** we are using synchronization and threading to calculate a Mandelbrot set in parallel.

In the **third exercise** we are solving the _Kindergarten_ problem:
In the Kindergarten there are both children and teachers with the restriction that each moment there must be at least one teacher for R children.
