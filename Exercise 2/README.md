# Exercise 2 (Process Management and inter-process communucation)

In the **first exercise** we are creating a _specific process tree_, where the return code for each process is A = 16, B = 19, C = 17 and D = 13. (A is parent of B and C and B is the parent of D)

In the **second exercise** we are creating an _arbitrary process tree_ based on a file input.

In the **third exercise** we are sending and handling _signals_ to monitor processes (examples of signals are SIGCONT,SIGSTOP)

In the **fourth exercise** we are doing a _parallel calculation of an arithmetic expression_ with the use of processes. The expression is given in a tree format, such as the one in the example.
